[Visit codingengineers.com for tutorials covering this code](https://www.codingengineers.com)

Example code for PIC32MKGPE100, covering I2C, SPI, UART, and basic GPIO

Code was tested usingth PIC32MKGPE100 development board, but could be used for other pic MCU's by changing registers

All code examples are dependent on SOLAR_ASSIST.c and SOLAR_ASSIST.h
